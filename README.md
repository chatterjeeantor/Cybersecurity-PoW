# Cybersecurity-PoW
This repository is a structured Proof of Work (PoW) portfolio documenting my continuous, hands-on technical proficiency and acquired skills across various disciplines within Information Security. It utilizes a monorepo architecture to centralize all lab artifacts, custom tooling, challenge write-ups, and security research findings.

The primary goal is to provide a demonstrable, verifiable record of my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical, real-world security challenges, strictly adhering to ethical hacking and secure coding standards.
